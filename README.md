<a name="scope"></a>
## 1. Overview
One-week school on gamma-ray astronomy organized at the Observatoire de Paris, designed for PhD 
students/postdocs/researchers eager to learn about gamma-ray astronomy data and the specific challenges of ground-based
Cherenkov observations and of high-energy data analysis. The science analysis tool [Gammapy](https://gammapy.org/), 
chosen by/for the international Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory [CTAO](https://www.ctao.org/), will be presented. 
Lectures and hands-on sessions (beginners and experienced users) will take place on two sites of the Observatoire de 
Paris, in Paris and Meudon.

Questions and discussion on specific projects:
- **Stellar arachnology at the highest energies: Identifying potential targets to CTAO**, by Livia Silva Rocha

Spider pulsars are binary systems where a low-mass companion orbits a millisecond pulsar in a short-period orbit (less 
than one day). These systems are categorized as black widows (m_c << 0.1 M_\odot) or redbacks  (m_c ~ 0.1 - 0.5 M_\odot),
depending on the companionâ€™s mass. The presence of long eclipses in these systems indicates intrabinary material, along 
with an intrabinary shock, which offers a promising environment for particle acceleration and gamma-ray emission at TeV 
energies. This work employs the Gammapy package to analyze available data on spider systems, primarily from Fermi-LAT, 
and plan to integrate a radiative model developed with the UMBRELA code to extract the spectral model of each binary. 
Simulated observations of the full sample of spider systems using the CTAO under its Alpha Configuration, based on the 
computed spectral models, will then help identify the most promising sources for detection with the next generation of 
Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs). This presentation will cover preliminary results, its challenges, and 
the next steps in the analysis.
